Search Quality search is the backbone of productivity. Slack allows users to search through titles, as well as search within shared documents and metadata. Search results can be filtered by their relevancy, how recently they occurred, or by what file type you may be looking for. Or, you can simply browse files if that's what you're looking for. However, the key to productive search in slack is the use of modifiers. Much like what you'll find in Gmail's search, these modifiers further filter search results to get you the answer more quickly. The following modifiers are available for search. From - When you're looking for content from a specific team member To - For something sent to a channel, group, or direct message In - For content within a channel, group, or direct message After - Something sent after a certain date Before - Something sent before a certain date On - Sent on a certain date During - Something sent during a month or year Has - Contains a star or a link Type the modifier with a colon following it, like "from:" and add what you want to include. Integrations Users can connect some of the apps and tools they already use in their workflow to Slack through its integrations feature. Common apps such as Dropbox, Github, Google Calendar, Jira, and many others. If you have some programming skills you can also build your own integrations or customize them to your liking. For example, you can integrate Twitter to have specific tweets post to certain channels. This works well for companies that handle customer service requests through social media. Also, integrating Google services like Hangouts allows you to start hangouts directly from a Slack channel.
