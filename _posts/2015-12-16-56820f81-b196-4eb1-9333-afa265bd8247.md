**Most people agree** that the internet has made our lives better. Instant global communication has transformed huge parts of our daily lives; we can find a piece of information instantaneously, buy practically anything with a couple of clicks, and order a cab with just a tap.

But there is a major aspect of our lives that has been stubbornly slow to change: office life. Yes, phone calls and letters have been replaced by emails, and almost all of the industries that we work in have been massively reshaped by the web, but our routines and working practices have evolved remarkably slowly.

* Although most of us have[powerful computers in our pockets][0], workers often remain tied to their desks. We spend hours in meetings that many attendees secretly, or not so secretly, loathe. A generation ago, office technology was miles ahead of that in the home, now the reverse is true. And email, rather than making us more productive,[has become a gargantuan battle against time][1], taking hours out of every working day.
