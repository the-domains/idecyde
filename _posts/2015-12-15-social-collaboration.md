engagement, it also relates to how social collaboration tools function on an
enterprise level. It's crazy to invest in technology without understanding how
it will sync/work with other applications to achieve overarching your company
objectives. When the objective is interconnectivity, social collaboration must
be woven into everyday business practices, as there is never any value in
programs that can't work together.
