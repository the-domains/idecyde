Taking Your Enterprise Mobile: 

An Executive Strategy 

Even though the transition of mobile
phones into computers has been a long time coming, the sea change in the past
two years is dramatic: Consumer mobile devices are so compelling and offer
business users such a powerful medium for learning, transacting, sharing and
presenting that companies are willing to up-end the "way we do things
around here" to have them. Becoming a mobile enterprise means new
opportunities for your organisation. 

Employees are happier and more
productive when they have mobile access to their e-mail, apps and data on
tablets and smartphones. Companies running their businesses on mobile workstyle
solutions gain competitive advantages and drive top-line growth. In a recent
survey, Aberdeen found that best in class enterprises are three times as likely
as all others to tie business workflow to users' mobile devices

People at all levels of the
organisation should have a strong desire to arm the workforce with mobile
devices and mobile access to corporate apps and data. Your competition will be mobilising
horizontally, across their lines of business. This can range from restaurant
chains equipping hosts and kitchen staff with iPad tablets to airlines
distributing the "flight bag" of electronic aircraft manuals, flight
plans and compliance documents to its aircrews. 

Give users device choice without impacting
compliance needs along with well thought out productivity apps that your users
love and your IT department embraces. Enable your business by allowing anywhere
access to the apps and provide an advanced administration solution that will
provide simple and secure user access. This strategy will make the business
armed and dangerous and will help your IT organisation and the rest of your
company embrace enterprise mobility and capture the many business opportunities
they will bring. Go forth and conquer.

It is important to set out and define
the company's goals for enterprise mobility. Specify whether you are to focus
on productivity improvements, top-line opportunities, and/or employee device
freedom. Ensure that your organization's mobile strategy reflects those goals.

Determine who will be mobile-enabled
(executives? sales? hourly workers? Everyone?). If the answer is not everyone,
decide which departments, title (i.e. managers and above), and/or business
reasons qualify to be mobile-enabled. 

Get to know the mobile goals and
timelines of your lines of business. Ensure that IT has taken into account
whether your LOBs intend to mobilise their favourite apps for their users and
partners and whether they have thought through and planned to develop or extend
custom apps for specific devices.

Finally make sure everyone understands
failure to mobilise is not an option any business that wants to be successful
can consider.
